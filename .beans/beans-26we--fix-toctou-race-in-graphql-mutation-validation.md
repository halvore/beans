title: Fix TOCTOU race in GraphQL mutation validation

Resolver mutations call Get() (returns a copy outside the lock), run validations, then call Update() (acquires the lock). Between Get and Update, another goroutine can modify the bean, making validations stale. The ETag check in Update() catches conflicts but validators could pass on state that's no longer valid.

## Proposed Fix

Move validation inside Update() under the lock, or introduce a CompareAndSwap-style method that validates + updates atomically.

## Affected Files

- internal/graph/schema.resolvers.go (lines ~240-356)
- pkg/beancore/core.go (Update method)
